# Admin authorization

There are a few more helper functions needed before we can set up proper authorization for "/admin" handlers.
Add following to `App` module:

```fsharp
open Suave.Cookie

...

let reset =
    unsetPair Auth.SessionAuthCookie
    >=> unsetPair StateCookie
    >=> Redirection.FOUND Path.home

let redirectWithReturnPath redirection =
    request (fun x ->
        let path = x.url.AbsolutePath
        Redirection.FOUND (redirection |> Path.withParam ("returnPath", path)))


...

let loggedOn f_success =
    Auth.authenticate
        Cookie.CookieLife.Session
        false
        (fun () -> Choice2Of2(redirectWithReturnPath Path.Account.logon))
        (fun _ -> Choice2Of2 reset)
        f_success

let admin f_success =
    loggedOn (session (function
        | UserLoggedOn { Role = "admin" } -> f_success
        | UserLoggedOn _ -> FORBIDDEN "Only for admin"
        | _ -> UNAUTHORIZED "Not logged in"
    ))
```

Remarks:

- `reset` is a WebPart to clean up auth and state cookie values, and redirect to home page afterwards. We'll use it for logging user off.
- `redirectWithReturnPath` aims to point user to some url, with the "returnPath" query parameter baked into the url. We'll use it for redirecting user to logon page if specific action requires authentication.
- `loggedOn` takes `f_success` WebPart as argument, which will be applied if user is authenticated. Here we use the library function `Auth.authenticate`, to which `f_success` comes as last parameter. The rest of parameters, starting with first are are respectively:
    - `CookieLife` - `Session` in our case
    - `httpsOnly` - we pass false as we won't cover HTTPS bindings in the tutorial (however Suave does support it).
    - 3rd parameter is a function applied if auth cookie is missing - that's where we want to redirect user to the logon page with a "returnPath"
    - 4th parameter is a function applied if there occurred a decryption error. In real world this could mean a malformed request, however at current stage we'll stick to reseting the state. This way we can re-run the server multiple times during development, without worrying about the browser to pass a cookie value encrypted with stale server key (Suave regenerates a new server key each time it is run).
- `admin` also takes `f_success` WebPart as argument. Here, we invoke `loggedOn` with an inline function using `session`. The interesting part is inside the `session` function:
    - syntax `function | ... -> ` is just a shorter version of `match x with | ... -> ` but the `x` param is implicit here, and `x` is of type `Session`
    - first pattern shows the real power of the pattern matching technique - `f_success` will be applied only if user is logged on, and his Role is "admin" (we'll distinguish between "admin" and "user" roles)
    - second pattern holds if user is logged on but with different role, thus we return 403 Forbidden status code
    - the last "otherwise" (`_`) pattern should never hold, because we're already inside `loggedOn`. We use it anyway, just as a safety net.

That was quite long, but worth it. Finally we're able to guard the "/admin" actions:

```fsharp
path Path.Admin.manage >=> admin manage
path Path.Admin.createAlbum >=> admin createAlbum
pathScan Path.Admin.editAlbum (fun id -> admin (editAlbum id))
pathScan Path.Admin.deleteAlbum (fun id -> admin (deleteAlbum id))
```

Go and have a look what happens when you try to navigate to "/admin/manage" route.

We still need to update the `partUser`, when a user is logged on (remember we hardcoded `None` for username).
To do this, we can pass `partUser` as parameter to `View.index`:

```fsharp
let index partUser container = 

...

            divId "header" [
                h1 (aHref Path.home (text "F# Suave Music Store"))
                partNav
                partUser
            ]
```

and determine whether a user is logged on in the `html` WebPart in `App` module:

```fsharp
let html container =
    let result user =
        OK (View.index (View.partUser user) container)
        >=> Writers.setMimeType "text/html; charset=utf-8"

    session (function
    | UserLoggedOn { Username = username } -> result (Some username)
    | _ -> result None)
```

We declared a sub function `result` which takes the `user` parameter.
`session` can be used to determine user state.
Effectively, we invoke the `result` function always but with `user` argument based on the user state.

The last thing we need to support is `logoff`. In the main `choose` WebPart add:

```fsharp
path Path.Account.logoff >=> reset
```

`logoff` doesn't require separate WebPart, `reset` can be reused instead.

That concludes our journey to Auth and Session features in `Suave` library. 
We'll revisit the concepts in next section, but much of the implementation can be reused.
