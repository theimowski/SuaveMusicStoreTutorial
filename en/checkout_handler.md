# Checkout handler

Now let's add a route for checkout (`Path.Cart`):

```fsharp
let checkout = "/cart/checkout"
```

a navigation button in `View.nonEmptyCart` :

```fsharp
let nonEmptyCart (carts : Db.CartDetails list) = [
    h2 "Review your cart:"
    pAttr ["class", "button"] [
            aHref Path.Cart.checkout (text "Checkout >>")
    ]

    ...
```

and GET handler for checkout in `App` module:

```fsharp
let checkout =
    session (function
    | NoSession | CartIdOnly _ -> never
    | UserLoggedOn {Username = username } ->
        choose [
            GET >=> (View.checkout |> html)
        ])
```

```fsharp
path Path.Cart.checkout >=> loggedOn checkout
```

Remarks:

- `checkout` can only be invoked if user is logged on. If there is `NoSession` or `CartIdOnly` we don't want to let anyone in.
- additionally we decorated the `checkout` WebPart with `loggedOn` in the routing code. This ensures to redirect user to logon form if necessary.

Now it's time to implement `placeOrder` function in the `Db` module:

```fsharp
let placeOrder (username : string) (ctx : DbContext) =
    let carts = getCartsDetails username ctx
    let total = carts |> List.sumBy (fun c -> (decimal) c.Count * c.Price)
    let order = ctx.``[dbo].[Orders]``.Create(DateTime.UtcNow, total)
    order.Username <- username
    ctx.SubmitUpdates()
    for cart in carts do
        let orderDetails = ctx.``[dbo].[OrderDetails]``.Create(cart.AlbumId, order.OrderId, cart.Count, cart.Price)
        getCart cart.CartId cart.AlbumId ctx
        |> Option.iter (fun cart -> cart.Delete())
    ctx.SubmitUpdates()
```

Explanation of the above snippet:

1. we retrieve all carts that belong to the given user
2. we count the total amount of cash to pay
3. a new order is created with current timestamp, total, and username
4. we invoke `SubmitUpdates` so that the `order` instance gets its `OrderId` property filled in
5. we iterate through all the carts and for each of them:
    1. we create `OrderDetails` with all properties
    2. we delete the corresponding `cart` from database. Note that we cannot delete the cart which is currently being iterated through, because it represents a row from database view `CartDetails`, not the table `Cart` itself.
6. finally we `SubmitUpdates` at the very end.

When user checks out the cart, we want to show him a following confirmation (`View` module):

```fsharp
let checkoutComplete = [
    h2 "Checkout Complete"
    p [
        text "Thanks for your order!"
    ]
    p [
        text "How about shopping for some more music in our "
        aHref Path.home (text "store")
        text "?"
    ]
]
```

With that in place, we can now implement the POST checkout handler:

```fsharp
POST >=> warbler (fun _ ->
    let ctx = Db.getContext()
    Db.placeOrder username ctx
    View.checkoutComplete |> html)
```

We need to invoke the `Db.placeOrder` in a warbler, to ensure that it's not called for the GET handler as well.

Phew, I think we're done for now!
