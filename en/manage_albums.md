# Manage albums

Let's start by adding `manage` to our `View` module:

```fsharp
let manage (albums : Db.AlbumDetails list) = [ 
    h2 "Index"
    table [
        yield tr [
            for t in ["Artist";"Title";"Genre";"Price"] -> th [ text t ]
        ]

        for album in albums -> 
        tr [
            for t in [ truncate 25 album.Artist; truncate 25 album.Title; album.Genre; formatDec album.Price ] ->
                td [ text t ]
        ]
    ]
]
```

The view requires a few of new helper functions for table HTML markup:

```fsharp
let table x = tag "table" [] (flatten x)
let th x = tag "th" [] (flatten x)
let tr x = tag "tr" [] (flatten x)
let td x = tag "td" [] (flatten x)
```

as well as a `truncate` function that will ensure our cell content doesn't span over a maximum number of characters:

```fsharp
let truncate k (s : string) =
    if s.Length > k then
        s.Substring(0, k - 3) + "..."
    else s
```

Remarks:

- our HTML table consists of first row (`tr`) containing column headers (`th`) and a set of rows for each album with cells (`td`) to display specific values.
- we used the `yield` keyword for the first time. It is required here because we're using it in conjunction with the `for album in albums ->` list comprehension syntax inside the same list. The rule of thumb is that whenever you use the list comprehension syntax, then you need the `yield` keyword for any other item not contained in the comprehension syntax. This might seem hard to remember, but don't worry - the compiler is helpful here and will issue a warning if you forget the `yield` keyword.
- for the sake of saving a few keystrokes we used a nested list comprehension syntax to output `th`s and `td`s. Again, it's just a matter of taste, and could be also solved by enumerating each element separately

We are going to need to fetch the list of all `AlbumDetail`s from the database. 
For this reason, let's create following query in `Db` module:

```fsharp
let getAlbumsDetails (ctx : DbContext) : AlbumDetails list = 
    ctx.``[dbo].[AlbumDetails]`` |> Seq.toList
```

Now we're ready to define an actual handler to display the list of albums.
Let's add a new sub-module to `Path`:

```fsharp
module Admin =
    let manage = "/admin/manage"
```

The `Admin` sub-module will contain all album management paths or routes if you will.

`manage` WebPart in `App` module can be implemented in following way:

```fsharp
let manage = warbler (fun _ ->
    Db.getContext()
    |> Db.getAlbumsDetails
    |> View.manage
    |> html)
```

and used in the main `choose` WebPart:

```fsharp
    path Path.Admin.manage >=> manage
```

Don't forget about the `warbler` for `manage` WebPart - we don't use an parameters for this WebPart, so we need to prevent it's eager evaluation.

If you navigate to the "/admin/manage" url in the application now, you should be presented the grid with every album in the store.
